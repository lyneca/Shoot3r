You have three lives and three bombs.
For every two bullets that hit you you lose a heart.
Bombs and the splash damage from the explosion makes you lose two hearts.
If you are going to try to read my code, good luck.
If you do read my code and want to take something out of it, that's fine, but
 please cite me :D
The spritesheet functions are not mine, but everything else is!
The files 'Singleplayer_RandomAI' and 'Singleplayer_TrackingAI' are my first attempts at
 an AI for this game.
Graphics and music are both my design, but the soundtrack (bleep bloop) is from a
 remake of the original Space Invaders.
Have fun :D
